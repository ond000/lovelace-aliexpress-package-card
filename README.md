## üåç Localization / Translations

This card supports displaying text in multiple languages using translation files located in the translations/ directory.

**How it Works:**

-   Each supported language has a JSON file (e.g., en.json, es.json).
    
-   The card uses English (en.json) as the default and fallback language. If a translation is missing in your selected language, it will display the English text instead.
    
-   An index.json file lists the available languages for selection in the card's editor.
    

**üôè Help Improve Translations!**

The current non-English translations were generated using AI and **may contain errors or sound unnatural**. We rely on the community to improve them!

**How to Contribute:**

1.  **Find the translations/ folder** in the card's source directory.
    
2.  **Copy en.json** and **rename** it using the [ISO 639-1 code](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FList_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for your language (e.g., pt.json for Portuguese).
    
3.  **Translate** the **string values** (text after the colons) in your new file. **Do not change the keys** (text before colons). Use a UTF-8 compatible editor.
    
4.  **Add your language** to translations/index.json, following the existing format (e.g., { "code": "pt", "name": "Portugu√™s" }).
    
5.  **Submit** your changes via a Pull Request or GitHub Issue on the card's repository.
    

Your contributions help make this card better for everyone!

## üöö Carrier Logos

This card displays carrier logos for easier visual identification.

**How it Works:**
-   Logos are mapped from carrier names to image URLs in the `carrier_logos.json` file.  
-   If a logo isn't in the file, the card attempts to use the carrier's website favicon as a fallback (requires carrier_url attribute).
    

**üôè Help Expand Logo Coverage!**
The included logo list might be incomplete. Adding logos for more carriers benefits everyone.
**How to Contribute:**
1.  **Find** a public URL for the missing carrier's logo.
2.  **Add** an entry to carrier_logos.json, mapping the exact carrier name (from attributes) to the logo URL. 
    ```
    // carrier_logos.json - Example Addition
    {
      // ... existing logos ...
      "Specific Carrier Name": "https://carrier.com/logo.png"
    }
    ```
    
3.  **Submit** your additions via a Pull Request or GitHub Issue on the card's repository.
    
Your contributions make the card more visually helpful!

If you have added custom carrier logos that you think would benefit other users, feel free to contribute them to the repository! Submit a pull request with your additions to the  `carrier_logos.json`  file. This helps improve the card for everyone.
